# Consistent-Hashing

This repository contains the implementation of `consistent hashing` in `C++` language. I followed the theory of conisistent hashing from the book System Design by Alex Xu during the implementation. 

## File Description
- `ConsistentHashing.cpp` : contains the implemenation of consistent hashing.
- `input.txt` : contains the sample input for consistent hashing.
